Algorithm Theory for "?ask" Application
=======================================

Introduction:
-------------

The "?ask" application allows users to ask questions or seek advice. The uniqueness lies in its ability to notify potential responders based on the context of the question, their interests, and bios, without solely relying on followers.

Challenges with Existing Platforms:
-----------------------------------

Current social platforms heavily rely on the number of followers a person has to get visibility on their posts or questions. This model has inherent challenges:

1.  **New or less popular users struggle to gain an audience.**
    
2.  **Questions from users without large followings may go unnoticed.**
    

Proposed Algorithm Overview:
----------------------------

In the "?ask" application, the goal is to combine the traditional "follower/following" mechanism with an interest-matching algorithm that ensures users, regardless of follower count, can still get meaningful responses. Here's how it can be done:

### 1\. Question Categorization:

Every question is categorized based on tags or topics. Users can choose from predefined tags or create their own. Tags may include categories like "tech," "health," "business," etc. These tags serve as the primary way to match users with questions.

### 2\. User Profiles & Interests:

Users create profiles that list their areas of expertise or interest (e.g., "JavaScript," "mental health," "cryptocurrency"). Users can be notified of questions that align with their areas of expertise, even if they're not following the question asker.

### 3\. Contextual Matching:

When a user posts a question, it gets analyzed by:

*   a) Tags chosen by the asker.
    
*   b) Content matching using NLP (Natural Language Processing) to identify additional related topics.
    

### 4\. Interest-Based Notifications:

Users with interests or expertise that match the question tags or the NLP-analyzed content are notified about the question. This ensures that even users with no followers can get responses based on shared interests.

### 5\. Reputation System:

A reputation system can be implemented to help weigh the importance of responses. As users provide high-quality answers, they gain reputation points. These points can prioritize their notifications for relevant questions, ensuring trusted responders engage with questions first.

### 6\. Dynamic Feed:

The user's feed will show questions based on:

*   a) Followed users' questions.
    
*   b) Questions that match their interest tags.
    
*   c) Random questions within the same broad category (e.g., "tech") to expose users to new topics and ensure engagement.
    

### 7\. Content Quality Filtering:

NLP algorithms can be employed to detect low-effort or off-topic questions, giving them lower priority in notifications. This ensures high-quality questions get visibility.

Conclusion:
-----------

This algorithm is designed to increase the visibility of users with fewer followers while still benefiting from traditional social media paradigms. It ensures that questions are seen by people who are most likely to have the expertise to provide useful answers, thereby creating a more inclusive and engaging experience.
